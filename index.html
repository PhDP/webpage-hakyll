title: About

  <p>I'm a computational scientist working on machine learning, a branch of
  Artificial Intelligence. My work is focused on deep transfer learning,
  which in layman's terms could be described as the capacity to
  automatically transfer knowledge between different tasks. It comes
  naturally to us, e.g.: we use what we learned for walking when learning to
  run, but almost all machine learning algorithms build models from scratch.

  <p>I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href=
  "http://chaire-eec.uqar.ca/"> Theoretical Ecosystem Ecology laboratory</a>
  (Université du Québec) and the <a href="http://qcbs.ca/">Quebec Center for
  Biodiversity Science</a> (McGill U.). My work is supported by an Alexander
  Graham Bell Graduate Scholarship from the <a href =
  "http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">NSERC</a>. I'm a member of the <a href=
  "http://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
  </a> and their <a href="http://cis.ieee.org/"> Computational Intelligence
  </a> society.</p>

  <p>I love programming! I was mostly programming in C and C++ but 2013
  marks my transition to functional languages (<a href=
  "http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="http://clojure.org/">
  Clojure</a>, and <a href=
  "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fsharp/">F#</a>).</p>
