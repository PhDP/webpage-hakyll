  <p>I'm a computational scientist working on machine learning, a branch of 
  Artificial Intelligence. I'm working on inductive transfer, which 
  in layman's terms could be described as the capacity to transfer knowledge 
  from one task to another. It comes naturally to us, e.g.: we use what 
  we learned for walking when learning to run, but machine learning 
  algorithms build models from scratch. Not only is it inefficient, but 
  being unable to rely on a vast and solid web of prior knowledge makes 
  machine learning vulnerable to overfitting. I mostly use the rich (and 
  complex!) data from ecological systems to develop and test my approaches.

  <p>I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href= 
  "http://chaire-eec.uqar.ca/"> Theoretical Ecosystem Ecology laboratory</a> 
  and the <a href="http://qcbs.ca/">Quebec Center for Biodiversity Science</a>.
  My work is supported by an Alexander Graham Bell Graduate 
  Scholarship from the <a href = "http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">NSERC</a>. 
  I'm a member of the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical 
  and Electronics Engineers</a> and their <a href="http://cis.ieee.org/">
  Computational Intelligence</a> society.</p>

  <p>I love programming! I was mostly programming in C and C++ but 2013 marks my
  transition to static functional languages (<a href=
  "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fsharp/">F#</a>, <a href=
  "http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">
  Scala</a>).</p>
