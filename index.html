title: About
---

<p>I'm a computational scientist working on machine learning and Artificial
Intelligence. My work is focused on deep transfer learning, which in layman's
terms could be described as the capacity to automatically transfer knowledge
between different tasks. It comes naturally to us, e.g.: we use what we learned
for walking when learning to run, but almost all machine learning algorithms
build models from nothing.</p>

<p>I'm mostly working on three aspects of A.I.: (1) the design of algorithms
capable of transferring knowledge, (2) the implementation of high-performance
agents on distributed systems (i.e.: the cloud), and (3) applications to
ecology.</p>

<p>I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href=
  "http://chaire-eec.uqar.ca/">Theoretical Ecosystem Ecology laboratory</a>
(Université du Québec) and the <a href="http://qcbs.ca/">Quebec Center for
Biodiversity Science</a> (McGill U.). My work is supported by an Alexander
Graham Bell Graduate Scholarship from the <a href =
"http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">NSERC</a> and a generous <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/azure/">Azure for Research Award
from Microsoft Research</a>. I'm a member of the <a href=
"http://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers </a>
and their <a href="http://cis.ieee.org/"> Computational Intelligence </a>
society. You can get my <a href="files/phdp-cv.pdf">short CV here</a>.</p>

<p>I love programming! I was mostly using C and C++ but these days I'm doing most of my work
with functional languages, especially <a
href="http://fsharp.org/">F#</a> and <a
href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a>.</p>
