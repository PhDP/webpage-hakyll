title: About
---

<p>I'm a computational scientist working on machine learning, a branch of
Artificial Intelligence. My work is focused on deep transfer learning, which
in layman's terms could be described as the capacity to automatically
transfer knowledge between different tasks. It comes naturally to us, e.g.:
we use what we learned for walking when learning to run, but almost all
machine learning algorithms build models from nothing.</p>

<p>I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href=
"http://chaire-eec.uqar.ca/">Theoretical Ecosystem Ecology laboratory</a>
(Université du Québec) and the <a href="http://qcbs.ca/">Quebec Center for
Biodiversity Science</a> (McGill U.). My work is supported by an Alexander
Graham Bell Graduate Scholarship from the <a href =
"http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">NSERC</a>. I'm a member of the <a href=
"http://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers </a>
and their <a href="http://cis.ieee.org/"> Computational Intelligence </a>
society.</p>

<p>I love programming! I'm mostly using C++11 and Python, although these days I'm
having a lot of fun with functional languages like <a href=
"http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and <a href="http://clojure.org/">
Clojure</a>. My work relies on many open source projects:
    <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux</a>,
    <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>,
    <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Google Chromium</a>,
