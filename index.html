title: About
---

<p>I'm a computational scientist working on Artificial Intelligence and its
application to complex biology problems. My work is focused on machine learning
problem called <b>deep learning transfer</b>, which in layman's terms could be
described as the capacity to automatically transfer knowledge between different
tasks. It comes naturally to us, e.g. we use what we learned for walking when
learning to run, but almost all machine learning algorithms build models from
nothing.</p>

<p>I'm mostly working on four aspects of A.I.: (1) the design of algorithms
based on probabilistic graphical models capable of transferring knowledge, (2)
structure learning with shortest-path algorithms, (3) the implementation of
algorithms on the cloud (<i>"AI as a Service"</i>), and (4) applications to
biology, most notably ecology.</p>

<p>I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href=
	"http://chaire-eec.uqar.ca/">Theoretical Ecosystem Ecology
laboratory</a> (Université du Québec) and the <a href="http://qcbs.ca/">Quebec
Center for Biodiversity Science</a> (McGill U.). My work is supported by an
Alexander Graham Bell Graduate Scholarship from the <a href =
"http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">NSERC</a> and a generous <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/azure/">Azure for Research
Award from Microsoft Research</a>. I'm a member of the <a href=
"http://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers </a>
and their <a href="http://cis.ieee.org/"> Computational Intelligence </a>
society. You can get my <a href="files/phdp-cv.pdf">short CV here</a>.</p>
