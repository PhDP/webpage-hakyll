  <p>I'm a computational scientist working on machine learning, a branch of 
  Artificial Intelligence. My work is focused on inductive transfer, which 
  in layman's terms could be described as the capacity to transfer knowledge 
  from one task to another. It comes naturally to us, e.g.: we use what we 
  learned for walking when learning to run, but almost all machine learning 
  algorithms build models from scratch. Not only is it inefficient, but 
  being unable to rely on a vast and solid web of prior knowledge makes 
  machine learning models vulnerable to overfitting and unable to deal with 
  new situations where little data is available. Furthermore, when 
  conditions change, it is hard to know if the model is still valid. I 
  mostly use the rich (and complex!) data from ecological systems to develop 
  and test new approaches to inductive transfer. </p>

  <p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href= "http://chaire-eec.uqar.ca/"> 
  Theoretical Ecosystem Ecology laboratory</a> (Université du Québec) and 
  the <a href="http://qcbs.ca/">Quebec Center for Biodiversity Science</a> 
  (McGill U.). My work is supported by an Alexander Graham Bell Graduate 
  Scholarship from the <a href = "http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">NSERC</a>. 
  I'm a member of the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical 
  and Electronics Engineers</a> and their <a href="http://cis.ieee.org/"> 
  Computational Intelligence</a> society.</p>

  <p>I love programming! I was mostly programming in C and C++ but 2013 marks my
  transition to static functional languages (<a href=
  "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fsharp/">F#</a>, <a href=
  "http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>).</p>
