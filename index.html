<p>I'm a computational scientist working on machine learning (a branch of
Artificial Intelligence) and its application to complex biology problems. I
focus on a problem called <b>transfer transfer</b>, which in layman's
terms could be described as the capacity to automatically transfer knowledge
between different tasks. It comes naturally to us, e.g. we use what we learned
for walking when learning to run, but almost all machine learning algorithms
build models from nothing.</p>

<p>I'm mostly working on four aspects of Artificial Intelligence / Machine
Learning: (1) the design of algorithms models capable of transferring
knowledge, (2) reinforcement learning, (3) the implementation of algorithms on
distributed systems, and (4) applications to biology, most notably
ecology.</p>

<p>I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href=
'http://chaire-eec.uqar.ca/'>Theoretical Ecosystem Ecology
laboratory</a> (Université du Québec) and the <a href='http://qcbs.ca/'>Quebec
Center for Biodiversity Science</a> (McGill U.). My work is supported by an
Alexander Graham Bell Graduate Scholarship from the <a href =
'http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/'>NSERC</a> and a generous <a
href='http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/azure/'>Azure for Research
Award from Microsoft Research</a>. I'm a member of the <a href=
'http://www.ieee.org/'>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers </a>
and their <a href='http://cis.ieee.org/'> Computational Intelligence </a>
society. You can get my <a href='files/phdp-cv.pdf'>short CV here</a>.</p>

<p>My work depends on many high-quality open-source software, especially the
following projects:
