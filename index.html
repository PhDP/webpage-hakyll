title: About
---

  <p>I'm a computational scientist working on machine learning (a branch of 
  Artificial Intelligence) and its application to ecology &amp; evolution. 
  I'm mostly working on inductive transfer, which in layman's terms could be 
  described as the capacity to transfer knowledge from one task to another.

  <p>I'm doing a Ph.D. at the <a href="http://chaire-eec.uqar.ca/"> 
  Theoretical Ecosystem Ecology laboratory </a> and the <a href= 
  "http://qcbs.ca/">Quebec Center for Biodiversity Science</a>. My work is 
  supported by an Alexander Graham Bell Graduate Scholarship from the <a href
  = "http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca">NSERC</a>.</p>

  <p>I love programming! These days I'm mostly using C++11 or C#, putting 
  Haskell to practice, and writing R scripts for statistics/plot.</p>
