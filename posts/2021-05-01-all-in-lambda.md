## [Functional] Programming

## Computer Algebra

This is not a jab at these systems (although, at some point, it...). As
shown by X, it's fairly straightforward to build a CAS on ...

## Artificial Intelligence

This one is a bit trickier... The last three domains

## The year of Haskell

To me, the point of using a formal system is not a fetish about pure
mathematics but the concrete [@chl07,@vez19]. [@des19]. [@chl07,vez19]

We'll adopt a more restrictive definition: Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure would
be untyped functional programming languages, while Haskell, Lean, Agda, Idris
would be typed functional programming languages.

## The Year of Haskell

The typed $\lambda$-calculi ranges from simple type theory (confusingly called
higher-order logic) to the richer dependently-typed lambda-calculi used by
most modern efforts to formalize mathematics (Lean, Agda, Coq). See \cite{ned14}.
