<p>A quick note. I saw a few lines of antiquated C++ in a Python presentation
for the obligatory "look-how-C++-sucks" bit. If you like Python, good for you,
I'm not here to bash it. But for the love of Hopper, stop freaking people out
with old, outdated C++. Many (most?) high-performance machine learning
libraries are written in modern C++, often with a Python interface. If you want
to understand how hot new tools like <a
href='https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow'>TensorFlow</a> or <a
href='https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK'>CNTK</a> work: you'll learn a lot by
diving into their C++ core.</p>

<p>The scary C++ examples follow a common theme: show how something simple is
absurdly contrived in C++ compared to Python. Hey let's create a vector (well,
it'll be a list in Python) of sets and print the result in some format:</p>

<pre><code class="python">sets = [{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {42, 47, 15}]

for set in sets:
  print('{ ', end='')
  for i in set:
    print(str(i) + ' ', end='')
  print('}')</code></pre>

<p>Clean and simple. Now the C++ version, Frankenstein's monster in coding
form, look how ugly it is:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;set&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

int main() {
  using namespace std;

  vector&lt;set&lt;int&gt; &gt; sets;

  {
    set&lt;int&gt; tmp;
    tmp.insert(1);
    tmp.insert(2);
    tmp.insert(3);
    sets.push_back(tmp);

    tmp.clear();
    tmp.insert(4);
    tmp.insert(5);
    tmp.insert(6);
    sets.push_back(tmp);

    tmp.clear();
    tmp.insert(42);
    tmp.insert(47);
    tmp.insert(15);
    sets.push_back(tmp);
  }

  vector&lt;set&lt;int&gt; &gt;::const_iterator it = sets.begin();
  for (; it != sets.end(); ++it) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "{ ";
    for (set&lt;int&gt;::const_iterator j = it-&gt;begin(); j != it-&gt;end(); ++j)
      cout &lt;&lt; *j &lt;&lt; ' ';
    cout &lt;&lt; "}\n";
  }

  return 0;
}</code></pre>

<p>Kill it! Kill it with fire (a certain unemployed red priestess could help)!
Everything from creating the vector of sets to looping is awful... Except
that's C++98. Nobody in their right mind is using C++98 unless they're forced
to. I'm not even sure this is good C++98 code, I haven't written with this
standard in ages. It's easy to forget not so long ago we couldn't write
vector&lt;set&lt;int&gt; &gt; without adding a space between the two &gt;&gt;.
In modern C++, the code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;set&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

auto main() -&gt; int {
  using namespace std;

  auto const sets = vector&lt;set&lt;int&gt;&gt;{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {42, 47, 15}};

  for (auto const& set : sets) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "{ ";
    for (int i : set)
      cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ' ';
    cout &lt;&lt; "}\n";
  }

  return 0;
}</code></pre>

<p>That's C++11 in action. I prefer this code to the Python version: it
type-checks, compiles to efficient code, and gives you better control over
memory (using references vs copy). You might prefer the Python version, fine,
but it's not <i>that</i> much simpler. Plus, as Python and C++
follow similar paradigms (except for type checking), the things that tend to be
annoying to write in C++, <a href='2015-04-05-automated-reasoning.html'>e.g.
handling abstract syntax trees</a>, are equally painful in Python. So stop what
you're doing, <a
href='http://www.informit.com/store/discovering-modern-c-plus-plus-an-intensive-course-9780134383699'>grab
a good book</a>, and learn modern C++.</p>
