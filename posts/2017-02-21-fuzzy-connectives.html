title: Fuzzy knowledge and fuzzy logic connectives
tags: fuzzy logic
---

<p>Interesting things are going on in the world of many-valued logic <a
href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06318'>as recent approaches to combine
first-order logic rules with deep learning tend to involve fuzzying the logic
predicates</a>. Whereas fuzzy logic is fairly simple to understand intuitively,
it has more connectives, or to be exact, alternative ways to define them.</p>

<p>In this post I'll explain a bit why fuzzy logic is interesting in the
context of knowledge representation. Then, I'll introduce various fuzzy logic
connectives and explain how they're connected. Fuzzy logic connectives are
based on triangular norms (T-norms), and the more formal treatments of the
subject tend to care only about conjunction (for good reason, we'll see why).
Here, my goal is to be very explicit and get derive the formulas to compute the
truth values. The maths are really simple, but hopefully the discussion will
still be interesting.</p>

<h2>From expert systems to scientific knowledge</h2>

<p>Fuzzy logic is a radical departure from normal logic. Everything you've done
in mathematics, computer science, and even probability theory, was bivalent.
True or false, and nothing else. Sure, you can say the probability to pick a
queen from a deck of cards is 1/13, but in the end, you'll either have a queen
or not. Again: true or false. Fuzzy logic breaks the mold, considering truth be
be a gradient from 0 (false) to 1 (true). There are various many-valued ("fuzzy")
logics, but here we'll always consider the truth values to be real numbers in
the [0, 1] closed range. An important thing to remember is that fuzzy logic is
a strict superset of bivalent logic, it's more general, and thus the
connectives should behave exactly like bivalent logic connectives when the
truth values are restricted to 0s and 1s.</p>

<p>There's a long tradition in A.I. of building expert systems, arguably the
most famous being MYCIN, which was used for infections, but what if we wanted a
system flexible enough to include complex scientific theories. Turns out that's
tricky. We've made a lot of progress on this front, with frameworks like <a
href='http://phdp.github.io/posts/2015-07-13-srl-code.html'>Markov logic</a>
allowing first-order logic rules to be associated with a weight, which in turn
allows probabilistic queries. Yet you're still limited to true/false values for
predicates. Take for example this seemingly simple idea: when a population is
small and has plenty of preys (or is an autotroph, in which case it has no
preys), it will experience exponential growth. With \(s\) for a species, \(l\)
for a location, and \(t\) for time, we could express the rule in predicate
logic as:</p>

\[SmallPop(s, l) \land (HasPreys(s, l) \lor Autotroph(s)) \Rightarrow N(s, l, t + 1) = R(s) \times N(s, l, t).\]

<p>Where \(SmallPop\) establishes whether the population is small, \(HasPreys\)
whether it has preys, \(Autotroph\) whether it needs preys, and the right-side
of the implication is the traditional formula for exponential growth in discrete
time (\(R\) is the rate of growth).</p>

<p>Even a probability of being true is just not enough, because we never expect
this rule to be exactly true. If you predict 102 rabbits and get 101, it's
"false". Furthermore, predicates like \(SmallPop\) and \(HasPreys\) are better
represented with nuances. With fuzzy logic, we could give a truth value for
\(SmallPop\) based on the current population size compared to a normal-sized
population, we could also quantify \(HasPreys\) on the population densities of
the preys, and perhaps more importantly, we could have an \(ExponentialGrowth\)
predicate and establish its truth value by comparing the predicted population
size to the real population size. In this framework, predicting 102 rabbits
when there are 101 would yield a truth value of 0.99 instead of 0. Note that
it's still possible to assign weights to fuzzy rules, in fact, it's exactly
what <a href='http://stephenbach.net/files/kimmig-probprog12.pdf'>probabilistic
soft logic</a> is about.</p>

<p>But enough exposition, let's explore how the connectives work.</p>

<h2>Normal logic is fuzzy logic with boring values</h2>

<p>With False = 0 and True = 1, you get the following connectives and truth
tables for standard logic:</p>

<table style='width: 100%; text-align:center;'>
  <tr>
    <th>Connective</th>
    <th>Informal name</th>
    <th>Symbol</th>
    <th>1 x 1</th><th>1 x 0</th><th>0 x 1</th><th>0 x 0</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Conjunction</td>
    <td>and</td>
    <td>\(\land\)</td>
    <td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Disjunction</td>
    <td>or</td>
    <td>\(\lor\)</td>
    <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Implication</td>
    <td>implies</td>
    <td>\(\Rightarrow\)</td>
    <td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Equivalence</td>
    <td>iff</td>
    <td>\(\leftrightarrow\)</td>
    <td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exclusive disjunction</td>
    <td>xor</td>
    <td>\(\veebar\)</td>
    <td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Plus, we have one unary connective, negation, represented by \(\neg\). In
practice all the connectives can be defined with only negation and
conjunction:</p>

\[x \land y.\]
\[x \lor y = \neg(\neg x \land \neg y).\]
\[x \Rightarrow y = \neg x \lor y = \neg (x \land \neg y).\]
\[x \leftrightarrow y = (x \Rightarrow y) \land (y \Rightarrow x) = \neg (x \land \neg y) \land \neg (y \land \neg x).\]
\[x \veebar y = \neg (x \leftrightarrow y) = \neg (\neg (x \land \neg y) \land \neg (y \land \neg x)).\]

<p>The definition of disjunction using only negation and conjunction leads us
to the famous De Morgan laws:</p>

\[\neg(x \land y) = \neg x \lor \neg y\]
\[\neg(x \lor y) = \neg x \land \neg y\]

<p>We won't talk about quantifiers (forall \(\forall\) and exists \(\exists\)),
let's just say that, even in this case, for a formula \(x\), the formula
\(\exists x\) could be written \(\neg \forall \neg x\). I say this because,
while we explore all the connectives here, formal texts will often define the
smallest possible set of symbols. The larger set of connectives and qualifiers
are mostly there for us, to make things easier to read and understand. Typical
pandering to humans :P. As a quick side note, there's intriguing work being
done on <a
href='http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-40566-7_5'>soft
qualifiers</a> for fuzzy logic. But back to the connectives...</p>

<h2>A first bite of fuzzy connectives</h2>

<p>With False = 0 and True = 1, and given that we expect the fuzzy connectives
to behave the same as bivalent connectives, we can have:</p>

\[\neg x = 1 - x.\]
\[x \land y = min(x, y).\]
\[x \lor y = max(x, y).\]

<p>So \(\neg 1 = 0\), \(1 \land 0 = 0\), \(0 \land 1 = 1\), you can check,
these connectives behave like normal bivalent connectives when they need to
but they're also defined for other values: with \(x = 0.1\) and \(y = 0.7\)
we get \(x \land y = 0.1\) and \(x \lor y = 0.7\). Let's try to see if
our definition of disjunction using only conjunction and negation works
too:</p>

\[x \lor y = \neg(\neg x \land \neg y).\]
\[x \lor y = \neg min(\neg x, \neg y).\]
\[x \lor y = 1 - min(1 - x, 1 - y).\]

<p>Turns out, \(max(x, y)\) is indeed the same as \(1 - min(1 - x, 1 - y)\).
To see why it's helpful to use a more geometric formula for the minimum and
maximum:</p>

\[max(a, b) = \frac{a + b + |a - b|}{2}.\]
\[min(a, b) = \frac{a + b - |a - b|}{2}.\]

<p>The intuition behind the formulas above is that the maximum is the mid-point
\((a + b)/2\) <emph>plus</emph> half the distance between \(a\) and \(b\) (i.e.:
\(|a - b|\)), while the minimum is the mid-point <emph>minus</emph> half the
distance. Back to our definition of disjunction:</p>

\[max(x, y) = 1 - min(1 - x, 1 - y),\]
\[max(x, y) = 1 - 0.5(1 - x + 1 - y - |1 - x - 1 + y|),\]
\[max(x, y) = 0.5(x + y + |y - x|).\]

<p>...and that's our definition of maximum (remember that \(|a| = |-a|\)).</p>

<p>Alright! We have our simple, happy definitions for conjunction and
disjunction with continuous values. These definition are awesome: they are both
simpler and more general than the truth tables we normally get for logic
connectives... but there's a catch: there are other ways to define the fuzzy
connectives. For example</p>

\[x \land y = max(0, x + y - 1).\]
\[x \lor y = min(1, x + y).\]

<p>Our first definitions for fuzzy connectives were based on the GÃ¶del T-norm,
while these are based on the Lukasiewicz T-norm. Again, is our definition of
disjunction from conjunction valid?</p>

\[x \lor y = \neg(\neg x \land \neg y),\]
\[min(1, x + y) = \neg max(0, \neg x + \neg y - 1),\]
\[min(1, x + y) = 1 - max(0, 1 - x + 1 - y - 1),\]
\[min(1, x + y) = 1 - max(0, 1 - x - y),\]
\[0.5(1 + x + y - |1 - x - y|) = 1 - 0.5(0 + (1 - x - y) + |0 - (1 - x - y)|),\]
\[0.5(1 + x + y - |1 - x - y|) = 1 - 0.5(1 - x - y + |x + y - 1|),\]
\[0.5(1 + x + y - |1 - x - y|) = 0.5(1 + x + y - |x + y - 1|),\]

<p>Works fine! These definitions might look needlessly complicated compared to
the simple \(min(x, y)\) for conjunction, but they often make more sense since
they combine the truth values instead of just discarding one like the
minimum.</p>

<p>Defining implication in Lukasiewicz logic is straightforward:</p>

\[x \Rightarrow y = \neg x \lor y,\]
\[x \Rightarrow y = min(1, 1 - x + y).\]

<p>As for equivalence:</p>

\[x \leftrightarrow y = (x \Rightarrow y) \land (y \Rightarrow x),\]
\[x \leftrightarrow y = min(1, 1 - x + y) \land min(1, 1 - y + x),\]
\[x \leftrightarrow y = max(0, min(1, 1 - x + y) + min(1, 1 - y + x) - 1),\]
\[x \leftrightarrow y = max(0, 0.5(4 - x + y - y + x - | x - y| - |y - x|) - 1),\]
\[x \leftrightarrow y = max(0, 1 - |x - y|).\]

<p>Technically, this is the definition of equivalence, but in practice since
\(x - y\) can never be greater than 1 with the truth values restricted to the
[0, 1] range, we can simplify to</p>

\[x \leftrightarrow y = 1 - |x - y|.\]

<p>And we'll define exclusive disjunction from there:</p>

\[x \veebar y = \neg (x \leftrightarrow y),\]
\[x \veebar y = 1 - (1 - |x - y|),\]
\[x \veebar y = |x - y|.\]

<p>We have all our connectives, plus two versions of disjunction and
conjunction. We'll now explore T-norm. Yes, there are more possible
connectives.</p>

<h2>Triangular norm (T-norm)</h2>

<p>So we have two ways to define conjunction, are there others? Yes! A
T-norm is a function from \([0, 1]^2 \rightarrow [0, 1]\) that satisfies the
following properties given \(x, y, z, z', y' \in [0, 1]\):</p>

<ol type="I">
  <li>\(t(x, 0) = 0\).</li>
  <li>\(t(x, 1) = x\).</li>
  <li>Commutativity: \(t(x, y) = t(y, x)\).</li>
  <li>Associativity: \(t(x, t(y, z)) = t(t(x, y), z)\).</li>
  <li>Monotonicity: If \(x \leq x', y \leq y'\), then \(t(x, y) \leq t(x', y')\).</li>
</ol>

<p>We also have the T-conorm, which has the same properties as the T-norm
except the the first two properties are changed to \(t(x, 0) = x\) and \(t(x,
1) = 1\).</p>

<p>So what is a T-norm? Multiplication, yes, simple plain multiplication, is a
valid T-norm:</p>

\[x \land y = x \times y.\]
\[x \lor y = 1 - ((1 - x) \times (1 - y)).\]
\[x \lor y = y + x - xy.\]

<p>At this point we have three ways to define conjunction: \(min(x, y)\), which
is called GÃ¶del's T-norm (or GÃ¶del-Dummett), \(max(0, x + y - 1)\) which is
Lukasiewicz' T-norm, and finally we have simple multiplication, often
called the product T-norm.</p>
