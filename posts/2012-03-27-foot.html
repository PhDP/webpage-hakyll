<blockquote>
<p>Many of the strengths and weaknesses of Hubbell's theory can be traced back to
Kimura’s neutral theory of molecular evolution. It is thus interesting to look
at how theoretical population geneticists have dealt with the theory since its
birth in the 1960s. In an insightful discussion of the neutral theory of
molecular evolution, Matthew Hahn noted that “[...] we have tied ourselves into
philosophical knots by using null models no one believes but are easily
parametrized.” In their opinion piece, Rosindell et al. note that neutral
theories are good starting points for more complex models. It’s a common
argument, and in many ways a sensible one, but it forces us to admit that the
other neutral theory (i.e. Kimura’s) proved to be a poor starting point in
practice. It did stimulate several extensions, including Tomoko Ohta’s nearly
neutral theory, but the original neutral model outrageously dominates molecular
biology. Not because it is a good representation of reality but simply because
it requires few parameters. We must seriously ask ourselves how to avoid the
"neutral trap" and make the neutral theory of biodiversity a step toward a more
integrative framework, not an endpoint. It’s a huge challenge, likely to
require new techniques and much creativity.</p>
