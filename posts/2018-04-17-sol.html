<p><a href='2015-07-13-fol.html'>I previously wrote a very short introduction
to first-order logic.</a> That introduction ignored many important questions,
like how to perform inference, and focused only on defining first-order logic
and providing some examples of what it could express. I wrote this intro
because first-order logic is a central player in researchers' effort to combine
symbolic with probabilistic representations, but a natural question arise: why
<b>first</b> order? Is there zeroth-order, second-order, higher-order? The
answers are: yes, yes, and yes, and here I'll briefly explain what second-order
and zeroth-order logics are.</p>

<p>First-order logic is a powerful symbolic representation for mathematical
ideas. Take Catalan's conjecture, explained in detail by <a
href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us-__MukH9I'>Holly Krieger in this
numberphile video</a>. In 1842, Eugène Charles Catalan wondered whether \((2^3 =
8, 3^2 = 9)\) was the only pair of consecutive perfect powers, i.e. the
power of a natural number greater than one such as \(2^3\), \(5^2\),
\(9^{15}\), ... We can formalize this conjecture in first-order logic:</p>

\[\exists! x, y, a, b \in \mathbb{N}: x > 0 \land y > 0 \land a > 1 \land b > 1 \land y^b = x^a + 1.\]

<p>\(\exists!\) is the unique quantifier ("there exists only one"), and \(x \in
\mathbb{N}\) reads "x belongs to the natural numbers". Preda Mihăilescu proved
it in 2002.</p>

<p>So what makes this formula <b>first</b> order? It means the formula only
quantifies over individual elements. In the previous formula, the variables
\(x, y, a, b\) ranged over individual elements (natural numbers). We call these
individual variables. They could also range over cities, presidential
candidates, species, complex numbers, vectors, etc etc, but they cannot, say,
range over functions or sets of elements. In a nutshell: second-order logic is
exactly like first-order logic in every way (same connectives, same predicates,
same quantifiers), but it allows quantification over sets, predicates, and
functions. It adds function variables and predicate variables (with sets being,
in essence, predicates). And that's it. For example, an important idea in
classical logic is that something either is or isn't in a set. It can be
written in second-order logic as:</p>

\[\forall x, S: x \in S \veebar x \not \in S\]

<p>with \(\veebar\) <a href='2015-07-13-fol.html'>being the <i>exclusive or</i>
symbol</a> and \(\in\) being the "belongs to" predicate. Here, \(x\) is an
individual variable, but \(S\) is a predicate variable, it represents sets, not
individual elements. You could definitely write specific versions of this
idea in first-order logic by replacing the predicate variable \(S\) with
specific sets:</p>

\[\forall x: x \in \mathbb{N} \veebar x \not \in \mathbb{N}.\]
\[\forall x: x \in \mathbb{C} \veebar x \not \in \mathbb{C}.\]
\[\forall x: IsFromVenus(x) \veebar \neg IsFromVenus(x).\]

<p>All these formulas are first-order, since they only quantify over individual
variables, but they fail to capture the general idea. Graph theory is famous
for second-order logic applications, with simple ideas like reachability being
difficult to define without second-order quantification. Another example is a
fairly important concept in optimization: the convexity of functions.</p>

\[\forall f, x, y, \alpha: Convex(f) \iff f(\alpha x + (1 - \alpha) y) \leq \alpha f(x) + (1 - \alpha) f(y)\]

<p>with \(\alpha \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1\), see <a
href='http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387303031'>Nocedal &amp; Wright
(2006)</a>. What makes this second order is the quantification over \(f\), a
function. We don't want to define convexity for a specific function, we want to
define it for all functions, hence the need for quantification over
functions.</p>

<h2>What about zeroth-order?</h2>

<p>There is no agreement on what is zeroth-order logic. It is often used to
refer to propositional logic, arguably the most primitive logic, where instead
of predicates we only have propositional symbols, e.g. \(x \land y \implies z\)
is a propositional formula with symbols \(x, y, z\). Since there are no
predicates, and thus no variables, constants, or functions, this is not really
useful to represent maths (although richer logics are often reduced to
propositional logic for inference). The other interpretation is that
zeroth-order logic is first-order logic without variables:</p>

\[CapitalOf(France) = Paris.\]
\[2^{2^2 + 2} = 64.\]
\[\neg Insect(Centipede).\]

<p>With this interpretation, a formula without variables is zeroth-order, one
with only individual variables is first-order, and one with function or predicate
variables is second-order.</p>
