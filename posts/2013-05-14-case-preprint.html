  <p>Initiated by a <a href="http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/07/18/esa-journals-do-not-allow-papers-with-preprints/">simple tweet</a>, 
  this collaboration on preprints in biology was ultimately accepted in PLOS Biology. The whole writing
  process was done on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/PhDP/article_preprint">here's the repo</a>).</p>
