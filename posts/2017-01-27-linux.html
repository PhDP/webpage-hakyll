title: Ten years on Linux
tags: linux

<p>I moved from Windows to <a href='https://www.linuxfoundation.org/'>Linux</a>
at the end of 2007, roughly ten years ago. I did many of the crazy things new
users do, from <a href='https://www.gentoo.org/'>Gentoo</a> to <a
href='https://www.archlinux.org/'>Arch</a>, but mostly used <a
href='https://getfedora.org/'>Fedora</a> and <a
href='https://www.ubuntu.com/'>Ubuntu</a>.</p>

<p>I thought ten years was worth writing about... but honestly, the big thing
to write about may be that there's little to write about. I installed Linux on
roughly a dozen machines in 2016 (my machines, plus some owned by friends and
family). The only issue I remember is having to install Ubuntu server on my
desktop computer because the graphical installer couldn't work with my the GTX
1080. I installed the server version, then NVIDIA's drivers, then the graphical
interface, et voil√†... A few days ago I completely removed Windows from an MSI
laptop (yeppie, GTX 1070 GPU!). It just works.</p>

<p>Linux is boring in a very nice, productivity-friendly way. Almost everything
I need, from Cuda 8 to compilers and librairies, can be installed with a simple
'sudo apt install'. It's probably not for everyone, but for machine learning
research I cannot imagine a better platform.</p>
