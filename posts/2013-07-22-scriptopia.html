title: Scriptoria.info - Tracking Science Manuscripts under Revision Control Systems

<p>There is widespread dissatisfaction with the way scientific publishing is
done, but fortunately many (cheaper) alternatives are emerging. Among these
alternatives is git (and revision control systems). Karthik Ram recently
wrote a piece on the use of git in science: <a href=
"http://www.scfbm.org/content/8/1/7/">http://www.scfbm.org/content/8/1/7/</a>
: highly suggestion reading.</p>

<p>The put it bluntly: revision control systems are more modern and
efficient than our peer-review system (my words, not his). With git and
github (a hosting service for git), <a href=
"https://github.com/PhDP/article_preprint/commits/master">changes are
tracked, with the full history of the document preserved in the repository
</a>. Collaborators can easily fork the repository of the manuscript, make
changes, and then push back the changes to a main repository.</p>

<p>Git was built to allow potentially thousands of developers to work on the
same code, create branches to test new ideas, and push back their changes
(if they want to merge everything into a single version). Better: websites
like <a href= "https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href=
"https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket </a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/">
Google Code</a>, Microsoft's <a href ="http://www.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>
, or <a href="http://gitorious.org/" > Gitorious</a> (itself an open source
project), allow the users to create open git repositories free of charge,
with wiki systems and bug tracking included.</p>

<p>Bug tracking is particularly great for science. Bug tracking systems are
essentially the software equivalent of asking a revision in a peer-review.
Found a problem with some paper? <a href=
"https://github.com/weecology/data-sharing-paper/issues/71"> Open a freaking
issue!</a> Open manuscripts and open reviews, all free, and all this thanks
to git, an open-source piece of software originally written for the Linux
kernel.</p>

<p>Git, and other similar systems, are potentially very disruptive and not
only for science, see <a href=
"http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_
government.html">Clay Shirky's great talk on the subject</a>. These systems
were built by software engineers with a great deal of experience on close
collaborations. Several scientists are already using git to write
manuscripts... the problem is, there is no way to search these manuscripts,
no way to know where they are.</p>

<p>Git et al. are decentralized and it's fine. Actually, I would rather not
have all scientific manuscripts at the same place. However, we need a tool
to track the manuscripts being developed on github, bitbucket, google code.
We need this tool both to browse these open manuscripts but also to create
incentives for scientists to push their manuscripts online as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>This is Scriptoria.info, a project to track manuscripts being written on
github, bitbucket, gitorious, and other hosting services git revision
control systems. The goal of Scriptoria is not to host repositories but
simply track them in the various hosting services, allow them to be search,
and offer a simple API. I see the project as a thin layer over an already
well-established system. Scriptoria is not ready (as of 2013.07.22), it's
just started! The code will be developed on <a href=
"https://github.com/PhDP/Scriptoria">github</a> and everyone is free to
contribute. <a href="https://twitter.com/recology_">Scott Chamberlain</a>
already suggested <a href= "https://github.com/PhDP/Scriptoria/issues/7">
(via an issue!)</a>
 a way to track the manuscripts...</p>
