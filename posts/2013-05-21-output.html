<p>In reorganizing my 「Writings」 section, I decided to put everything on the 
same page. Peer-reviewed articles, science popularization, notes, they all 
stand together as one. I'll just add tags to allow easy browsing.</p>

<p>For now this website runs on Hakyll, a Jekyll-like static generator 
written in Haskell.</p>
