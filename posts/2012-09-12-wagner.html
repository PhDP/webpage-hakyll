  <p>This paper describes a very simple model to generate phylogeographies 
  under allopatric/parapatric speciation. The C++11 code is on github: <a href=
  "https://github.com/PhDP/wagner">github.com/PhDP/wagner</a>.</p>

  <p>I have a love/hate relationship with this model. I love it as an 
  algorithm: it's an elegant way to get a speciation-like behavior in space. 
  I hate it because I increasingly doubt this kind of very simplific 
  'bottom-up' model can bring much ecological insights.</p>
  
  <p>I named this model <i>Wagner</i> in honor of Moritz Wagner, one of the 
  first scientist to argue for the importance of geographic isolation
  in speciation.</p>
