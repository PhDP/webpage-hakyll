title: CMake project templates for C++11 and CUDA with google test/benchmark support
tags: cmake, build, c++

<p>Books generally don't cover project organization and few introductions to
C++ discuss testing frameworks, let alone benchmarking. In my experience, many
science students compile without optimization flags, don't know how to separate
header and source files, tests, etc etc. So I created two simple <a
href='https://cmake.org/'>cmake</a> project templates. One for C++11 (with a
library and an executable) and one for CUDA. Both support testing with <a
href='https://github.com/google/googletest'>Google Test</a> and benchmarks with
<a href='https://github.com/google/benchmark'>Google Benchmark</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/PhDP/cmake-gtest-gbench-starter'>C++11 cmake project with google test / google benchmark support.</a></li>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/PhDP/cuda-cmake-gtest-gbench-starter'>C++/CUDA cmake project with google test / google benchmark support.</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href='https://cmake.org/'>CMake</a> is a popular tool for building
cross-platform C++ applications, you shouldn't have any issue installing
it.</p>

<p>The C++ project template works on both Linux/UNIX and Windows, while the
CUDA project is tested only on Linux. Feel free to fork / suggest
improvements.</p>
