<h2>Operating System</h2>

<p>I use Linux everywhere (laptops, virtual machines, phones/tablets if we count Android). Ubuntu GNOME.</p>

<p>As for C or C++, unless forced to use gcc, I'll go with LLVM/clang.</>

<p>I'm not very comfortable on Windows, but I'd love to build a service on Windows/F# at some point to
learn a bit more on the OS. It has at least one feature I really like: a much, much better scheduling
system than Linux.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>Almost everything I care about is either on Dropbox, or in a git repository
(bitbucket, github).</p>

<p>As for editors: for now it's Atom for Haskell, vim for everything else. Might use
Atom for Rust too, but I'll probably keep vim for C, C++, CUDA, LaTeX.</p>

<h2>Laptops</h2>

<p>I always have at least a primary laptop and a secondary (generally smaller) one.</p>

<h2>Backpacks</h2>

<p>The ebags is much, much better. The only downside of the XXX is the </p>

<h2>Tablet</h2>

<p>I use tablets to read and almost nothing else, but it's important since I
read a lot, and I'm trying very hard to ditch all my physical books. I use dropsync
to sync all my PDF files to my tablets.</p>

I own a Nexus 7 and a Dell Venue 8 7000. The Nexus feels better... but I tend to carry
around the Dell because of its larger, better screen. But seriously, why are so
many companies using metal? Sure, the Dell Venue 8 would be a bit thicker with plastic,
but who cares? It would certainly feel better in the hand, grippier and warmer.

<h2>Pens &amp; Notebooks</h2>

<p>My favorite notebooks are by far the Moleskine squared hardcover, both the large and A4.</p>

<p>As for pens... I have yet to find something better than the Pilot G2, Pilot
Juice, or Zebra Sarasa pens. Yes I'm serious. A friend showed me an expansive
<a href='http://karaskustoms.com/pens/retrakt-brass.html'>Karas pen</a>, in full metal, about 30 times the cost of a Pilot G2... and
compatible with G2 refills. I prefer the cheap plastic G2. Again, metal is
cold, needlessly heavy for a pen, and I like the rubber grip in the cheap
G2/Juice/Sarasa pens.</p>

<p>While a fews of my pens have 0.5mm tips, I mostly use 0.7mm tips, the stronger
line is better for filling areas and scanning pages.</p>
